- VkInstance represents the API context
- VkPhysicalDevice represents a physical GPU in the system
- VkDevice represents a device driver which serves as our main way of interacting with said GPU
	Holding multiple instances of this (one per GPU) allows you to switch which GPU you use

- You allocate a command buffer from a command pool
	Record commands into the buffer
	Submit the buffer to a queue which starts executing the commands
- Recording commands is cheap and can be done via multiple threads but can only be submitted from one
- It's common to have 3 queue families: drawing the frame, async compute and one for data-transfer
- Command pools are created from the device and require the index of the family to which they belong

* Note: for some reason changing the required cmake version from 3.8 to 4.0 alters the structure
	of the project/solution and causes the SDL project to break as it can't find runtime-check related symbols?
